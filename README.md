# craps-text-java
This is a text based java craps game. It is currently fully functional, although still a work in progress. Currently, the app supports pass line bets, and place bets. Soon to come will be don't pass bets.
In the near future, I hope to have a 'help' system to give advice to players who might not know what craps is. I want this app to be as new player friendly as possible. 

Other cool additions that I want to implement would be a default betting system, where a user can configure their own betting patterns and have the game play itself. This would allow a player to simulate thousands of rolls in a matter of seconds, and see how their betting strategies perform over the long run.

I spent 5 years working in the casino industry, specifically dealing in table games. Craps was always my favorite game to deal, and was the reason I was interested in the industry. I have always been fascinated by the simplicity of the statistics of a pair of dice. 36 combinations. Nice and simple. 

As I no longer work in the casino industry, working on this app makes me remember some of the fun memories I have of dealing craps in my past!
